# Project Specifications and Design Parameters

Tharsis Technologies Rover Division is committed to engineering excellence. The MRR project's design parameters adhere to rigorous standards for durability, autonomy, and scientific capability.

## Design Constraints
- Footprint: Maximum of 15" x 15".
- Material: Use only specified materials, with a detailed cost analysis required.

## Sensor and Microcontroller Integration
- Must feature at least one navigation-enhancing sensor.
- Governed by custom software running on an Arduino platform, documenting all iterations.

## Autonomy Requirements
- The rover must independently navigate the Martian replica terrain without intervention.
